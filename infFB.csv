Virtual Adult Day services has shown great promise in retaining membership and bringing cost-effective ADS operations to centers that are confronting staff shortage and closure. As re-opening is on the horizon in many states, centers are facing the irony that members will not return to the center 100%. The legacy of the pandemic for a hybrid model of “Virtual + Physical” deliveries is here to stay.

HealthJay, a NADSA Strategic Partner, is partnering with NADSA to offer the “Hybrid ToolBox” that supports virtual programming, virtual and physical attendance check-in, integrated activity scheduling and enrollment, and electronic validation of remote services.

Objectives of this session include:

Overview of “why this is important.” HealthJay’s founders and center executives will talk about why Hybrid ADS is a demonstration of value-based services and how hybrid technology will benefit Adult Day centers.
Highlight how Hybrid ADS sets the stage for Person-Centered Care that Adult Day stakeholders (CMS, MCOs and various Payers) use as a benchmark for reimbursement
Answer: ‘What’s in it?” for providers and the Adult Day Service Sector. How will the Hybrid ToolBox be a “Revenue Generator” instead of “Another Tech” that costs money.
Explanation of how Hybrid models, by using data collection, is the pathway for real revenue growth and membership sustainability after many immediate fixes of using virtual programming during the pandemic.
Operationalize a dual model of Adult Day service delivery by having a data collection and management platform.
Learn about the Hybrid Checklist that ADS center executives should know as we plan for re-opening.
About the presenters:

HealthJay, a NADSA Strategic Partner, is partnering with NADSA to offer the “Hybrid ToolBox” that supports virtual programming, virtual and physical attendance check-in, integrated activity scheduling and enrollment, and electronic validation of remote services.

Objectives of this session include:

Overview of “why this is important.” HealthJay’s founders and center executives will talk about why Hybrid ADS is a demonstration of value-based services and how hybrid technology will benefit Adult Day centers.
Highlight how Hybrid ADS sets the stage for Person-Centered Care that Adult Day stakeholders (CMS, MCOs and various Payers) use as a benchmark for reimbursement
Answer: ‘What’s in it?” for providers and the Adult Day Service Sector. How will the Hybrid ToolBox be a “Revenue Generator” instead of “Another Tech” that costs money.
Explanation of how Hybrid models, by using data collection, is the pathway for real revenue growth and membership sustainability after many immediate fixes of using virtual programming during the pandemic.
Operationalize a dual model of Adult Day service delivery by having a data collection and management platform.
Learn about the Hybrid Checklist that ADS center executives should know as we plan for re-opening.

The risk of developing blood clots in the general public is about 0.1%.
The risk of developing clots if you are a woman on birth control is between 0.3% and 1%.
The risk of developing blood clots after a serious case of CoVID is 20-30%.
The risk of developing a clot after J and J vaccination is currently .00088% (6 clots /68000000 doses given X 100).
The pause is necessary to collect data. However, remember my FAVORITE catchphrases of CoVID-19
CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION
and
RISK-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
At this moment the risk of developing a clot by walking down the street is higher than the risk of developing a clot after vaccination.
If you have received J and J's vaccine, don't panic. However, if you develop any new symptoms within about 3 weeks of vaccination, let us (your doctors) know.
Again, the numbers are extremely small.
The pause on J and J vaccinations is bad news for our immunization plan but people who have already received the vaccine need to remain calm and discuss concerns with their doctors.",,"Christine Meyer, MD‎PA CoVID Vaccine Match Maker
